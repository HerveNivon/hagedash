# hagedash

Realtime dashboard to support [`buzzard`](https://www.github.com/airware/buzzard) next iteration.

Temporary hosted on https://github.com/HerveNivon/hagedash

# Launching the dashboard server

## Python 2.7

```
$> cd client/build
$> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000
```

## Python 3.6

```
$> ./hagedash.py
```

Which is mostly equivalent to `python3 -m http.server`

## Development

### Pre requisite

You must have `npm` installed to develop and build the `hagedash` dashboard.

### Starting the dashboard for development purpose

The `hagedash` dashboard is a react application located in the `client` folder of this repository.

To start the live reload feature simply:
```
$> cd client
$> npm start
```

See [`client/README.md`](client/README.md) for more information.

### Debugging in the Editor

Debugging the dashboard in the Editor has only been tested in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

This enables you as a developer to write and debug your React code without leaving the editor, and most importantly it enables you to have a continuous development workflow, where context switching is minimal, as you donâ€™t have to switch between tools.

You would need to have the latest version of [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [VS Code Chrome Debugger Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome) installed.

Start your app by running npm start, and start debugging in VS Code by pressing `F5` or by clicking the green debug icon of the debugger panel. You can now write code, set breakpoints, make changes to the code, and debug your newly modified codeâ€”all from your editor.

See [Debugging in the Editor](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#debugging-in-the-editor) for additional details regarding other editors.

## Build

```
$> cd client
$> npm build
```

See [`client/README.md`](client/README.md) for more information.

### Launch the Mock websocket server

Launch the websocket server. It will create a websocket server on `http://localhost:8001/websocket`.

```
$> ./hagedash_mock.py
```

### Development todo
1. [X] Set the development pipeline (https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html)
2. [X] Build the data management through websockets
3. [ ] Build the bar charts
4. [ ] Build the donut chart
5. [ ] Build the timeline chart
6. [ ] Build the brush over timeline for selection
7. [ ] Build the interactive sankey
8. [ ] Set the building process for distribution along with `buzzard`
9. [X] Make the distribution trough `./hagedash.py`
10. [ ] Dispatch the "Connect" action automatically on page load
11. [X] Stop automatic re-connection on manual disconnect
12. [ ] Change logo and header
13. [ ] Add bootstrap to make things nicer
14. [ ] Data validation in the websocket handler
15. [ ] Optimized computed properties (in order to avoid their computation within all components)
16. [ ] Add tests ðŸ˜‡
